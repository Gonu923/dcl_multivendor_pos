            Shahana Nazim Sultana Nab is the Director of Dhaka Choice Ltd.
            Progress for me has never been a dream. It has always been a distant
            reality and once one milestone is achieved, there is always another
            one waiting to be crossed. It is with this belief that I started
            Dhaka Choice Ltd. in 2021, a company that was in the business of
            Online Business Platform. Almost instantly, Dhaka Choice Ltd. became
            a prominent name in its business segment, but like every
            entrepreneur sticks to their dream; I always wanted to push my
            company to more prosperous milestones. More than being a global
            player, I always perceived my company as a unit that could make a
            difference with its quality and competitively priced products. A
            highly sensitive business that requires a high amount of technical
            know-how, expertise and specialized knowledge. The journey of Dhaka
            Choice Ltd is never ending. But with the support of my team and
            clients, I am confident that the company will continue to scale
            milestones of excellence for years to come.
